Unfortunately, you simply don’t know what you don’t know. Instead, think about using an actual expert in the field. Did you know that realtors are required to complete 30 hours of continued education every two years to keep their license active? Covering such topics as Environmental Issues (i.e., Radon, Lead, Asbestos & Mold Remediation), Property Inspections, Law and Rule, Risk Management, Disclosures and Obligations, and how to write Conditions and Contingencies.  In addition, my 21 years of local experience has provided me a wealth of knowledge for many other types of situations. Over the years, my experience includes land sales, luxury home sales, investment properties, Short Sales, Owner Carry transactions & others.  We understand the rules and guidelines to using specific forms for specific situations. Disclosure forms vary on the kind of property that you are selling. In addition, if there are some new rules or laws that have changed and we are apprised of those updates. We take those liabilities on, when selling your home and hope that we can help you by allowing you to focus on your new move and not the legalities. 

Selling your own home is a lot more than just finding the right buyer. We start by making sure that your buyer is a pre-approved, they have a pre-approval letter that comes from a certified lender.  We make sure that the multitude of tasks needing to be completed through escrow are met.  The timelines are met on the contract and that both parties are aware of all the paperwork that is being asked of them to sign. In addition, we manage the time guidelines involved in inspections, appraisals engineering reports, or anything else that might be needed as part of the sale.  

These are just a few reasons why over 70% of For Sale by Owners, choose to go with a professional after 30 days. We are happy to explain this further, if you have any questions or would like to meet with us regarding the sale of your home give us a call.
